From that point on, we spent maybe 12 hours apart; the rest was <span class=active>walking hand in hand down the river Cam, watching the nonchalant punting tourists</span><span>eating dumplings on Jesus College lawn, getting lost in the library stacks</span><span>sitting in the grass on the lawn of King's College, waiting in line for the Footlights Pantomime</span>, filling in the outline of a love story I’d concocted in my head while reading novels and Instagram posts by women studying abroad at Cambridge, but mostly while getting dumped years prior by a different guy at university. It was the perfect end to what had been an otherwise unremarkable year.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">Eventually I needed to leave for a new job in San Francisco. He needed to stay to finish his PhD. I begged the airline to let me change my flight. He sprinted to the train station to say goodbye.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">I always assumed you don’t realize when you’re living in a cliche. But, in actuality, when you’re on one end of the romantic comedy trope, waiting at the station for a person who just so happens to look like they <span>could have appeared in an Ezra Pound poem</span>, you recognize and fear the inevitable final scene. Nothing can actually stay trite forever. In real life the ending is never so neat.

  </section><section id="section-1" class="gpt3"><div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">GPT-3 — the third “generative pre-trained transformer” released by the start-up (and my employer) OpenAI — is an example of a language model, or a tool that predicts what sequence of words should follow a user-provided prompt. For example, given a prompt like, “Hello my name” it will, more often than not, suggest that the next word is <span>“is.”</span>
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">It happens to be the biggest publicly released model of its kind: 175 billion parameters. The next largest is 17 billion. You can think of a parameter roughly as a synapse; the human brain has around 100 trillion of those, but it has to focus on lots of things besides language, like swiping on dating apps and moving to San Francisco. To learn all of those parameters, GPT-3 is trained on hundreds of billions of sentences and stories from the internet and books. Written something on Reddit? There’s a good chance GPT-3 has read it.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">This scale results in some remarkable generalizations: while the model has not eaten dumplings on the King’s College lawn, it has “read” Sylvia Plath and Caroline Calloway and every Modern Love essay ever written and it has “learned” heartbreak from Tosca and Taylor Swift and back issues of Sassy. Because the model has read from so many different sources with so many different authors, and also because it is a computer, the model lacks self-awareness, so, given a prompt like “Hi, I’m Pamela and Omar doesn’t love me” it will respond as me, Pamela, and <span>write the story of a relationship with all the poeticism and pathos and, yes, melodrama, that any young woman who has been dumped could ever want.</span>
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">Often, GPT-3 reverts to calling me "young woman" or otherwise frames my writing as youthful and feminine — an excerpt from a teen magazine. I wonder who the young woman is. Was she also raised on Scorcese and Saturday Night Live? Will her writing eventually outgrow the young woman label? My mother points out I'm not really that young.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">The model is far from a qualified therapist and access is governed by strict usage guidelines. Last August, I got access to the model for the first time. In the loneliness of month five of quarantine, having moved home to face my teenage journals, I didn’t know if I missed talking to strangers or if I missed talking to Omar. But I wanted to know if, with enough prodding, I could turn GPT-3 into either, or at least convince myself that I had.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">I set out to get to know the model — could it write break-up songs, answer questions about a story, identify what went wrong in a relationship — as I tried to forget Omar.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-fosfwn">I entered different permutations of my story, asking the model questions of what had gone wrong, hoping I could identify variables to land at the ending I wanted, or, I thought, find the variable that was to blame for the ending I had.
