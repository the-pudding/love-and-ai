<section id="section-0"><div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block svelte-fosfwn">Omar and I matched 13 days before I left England. From that point on, we spent maybe 12 hours apart; the rest was <span class=active>walking hand in hand down the river Cam, watching the nonchalant punting tourists</span><span>eating dumplings on Jesus College lawn, getting lost in the library stacks</span><span>sitting in the grass on the lawn of King's College, waiting in line for the Footlights Pantomime</span>, filling in the outline of a love story I’d concocted in my head while reading novels and Instagram posts by women studying abroad at Cambridge, but mostly while getting dumped years prior by a different guy at university. It was the perfect end to what had been an otherwise unremarkable year.
</p><p class="block svelte-fosfwn">Eventually I needed to leave for a new job in San Francisco. He needed to stay to finish his PhD. I begged the airline to let me change my flight. He sprinted to the train station to say goodbye.
</p><p class="block svelte-fosfwn">I always assumed you don’t realize when you’re living in a cliche. But, in actuality, when you’re on one end of the romantic comedy trope, waiting at the station for a person who just so happens to look like they could have appeared in an Ezra Pound poem, you recognize and fear the inevitable final scene. Nothing can actually stay trite forever. In real life the ending is never so neat.

</p><p class="block svelte-fosfwn">I am not a writer, I am a machine learning engineer. In my work the question of whether something is cliche is steeped in data and trendlines: How close is it to the average of a distribution? How does it compare to the mode? Answering these questions requires poring over every piece of a dataset, extracting features that might mean something, identifying every possible inflection point. When I try to apply this energy to my love life (or lack thereof), friends tell me I’m “dwelling too much on the past” or “living in a fantasy world” or “not really their friend.”
</p><p class="block svelte-fosfwn">So, when two years had passed and my feelings for Omar still weren’t resolved, I didn’t tell my friends. I told a supercomputer.
