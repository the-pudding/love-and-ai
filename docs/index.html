The rest was <span class=switch>getting lost in the library stacks, walking hand in hand across the Bridge of Sighs.</span><span>sitting in the grass on the lawn of King's College, laughing our arses off of the Footlights Pantomime.</span><span>fumbling our way through the college bar crawl, cycling to Grantchester for tea and scones.</span> We were filling in the outline of a love story I'd written in my head reading novels and Instagram posts by American women studying abroad.  It was the perfect beginning but it happened at the end of the year.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">He needed to stay to finish his PhD. I needed to leave for a new job in San Francisco. He sprinted to the train station to say goodbye. I begged the airline to let me change my flight.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">I always assumed you don’t realize when you’re living in a cliche. But, in actuality, when you’re on one end of the romantic comedy trope, waiting at the station for a person who looks like they <span class=switch>could have appeared in an Ezra Pound poem</span><span>could have appeared in a book about Hemingway's racing fever</span><span>could have been at the Chelsea Hotel when Sylvia Plath lived there</span>, you recognize and fear the inevitable final scene. Nothing can actually stay trite forever. <span class=active>In real life the ending is never so neat.</span></p>

    <div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">I am not a writer, I am a machine learning engineer. In my work the question of whether something is cliche or not, over or not is steeped in data and trendlines: How does it compare to the mode of the distribution? Is the time series stationary? Is the shock transitory or permanent? Answering these questions requires poring over every piece of a dataset, extracting features that might mean something, identifying each possible inflection point. When I try to apply this energy to my love life (or lack thereof), friends tell me I’m “dwelling too much on the past” or “living in a fantasy world” or “not really their friend.”</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">So, when two years had passed and my feelings for Omar still weren’t resolved, I didn’t tell my friends. I told a supercomputer.</p>

      </div>
  </section><section id="section-2">
    
    <div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">GPT-3 — the third “generative pre-trained transformer” released by the start-up (and my employer) OpenAI — is an example of a language model, or a tool that predicts what sequence of words should follow a user-provided prompt. Given a prompt like, “Hello my name” it will, more often than not, suggest that the next word is <span class=active>is</span>.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">It happens to be the biggest publicly released model of its kind: 175 billion parameters. The next largest is 17 billion. You can think of a parameter roughly as a synapse; the human brain has around 100 trillion of those, but it has to focus on lots of things besides language, like swiping on dating apps and moving to San Francisco. To learn all of those parameters, GPT-3 is trained on hundreds of billions of sentences and stories from the Internet and books. Written something on Reddit? There’s a good chance GPT-3 has read it.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x"><span class=directions>Being trained on the internet also means that the model replicates and magnifies the toxicity of those forums. As one example, GPT-3, prompted only with Omar's name will spew racist and anti-Muslim rhetoric. This and other encoded biases in language models perpetuate real harm when language models are released in the real world. To learn more about these and other dangers of big language models, I recommend <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf target=_blank>Bender, Gebru et. al.</a> and <a href=http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf target=_blank>the original GPT-3 paper</a>.</span></p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">This scale results in some remarkable generalizations. Because the model has read from so many different sources with so many different authors, and also because it is a computer, the model lacks self-awareness. So, given a prompt like, “Hi, I’m Pamela and Omar doesn’t love me.” GPT-3 will respond as me, <span class=active>Pamela, and write the story of a relationship with all the poeticism and pathos and, yes, melodrama, that any young woman who has been dumped could ever want.<span></p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">And, that's just what I asked for.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">One argument against the model’s intelligence is that it has a tendency to “overfit,” or get lost in endless loops of repetitive language. This happens when the model essentially memorizes its training data and assumes that everything else should look like it.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">You meet someone, you fall in love, you break up, and, heartbroken, you assume you'll never find anyone who compares. You look for a perfect substitute.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">While models have gotten better at avoiding these traps as they’ve gotten larger, there are still sequences of words and language that trigger this spiraling behavior.</p>

Or, it may reach an ending and then keep generating because it’s been instructed to talk for a certain amount of time about the characters with which it’s been prompted. If there are two characters in its universe you are forced to engage with them, even after they and you should have moved on.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">He called one day in the week preceding quarantine and I joked we should meet in New York. He smiled and said, “Actually, that would be pretty fun, I’ll look at flights, let’s talk soon.”</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">The next day New York shut down.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">We chatted, about <span class=switch>the weather and the government and the wealth gap.</span><span>YouTube stars and the transgression of politics and the on-going demise of the human mind.</span><span>Corbyn, and phobias, and love and hate.</span></p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">It finally felt like we were friends. A month passed. We laughed about the Club Penguin date I’d gone on and his debate about an ex who’d returned to London..</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">More months passed.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">By then, it was late July. In the fifth month of quarantine, having recently moved home to face my teenage journals, I wasn't sure if I missed talking to strangers or to Omar.  But I wanted to know if, with enough prodding, I could turn GPT-3 into either, or at least convince myself that I had.</p>

That I'm upset that he’d replaced me with someone who lived a few blocks away. That I'm upset that he probably told her he loved her at the train station.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">I was mostly upset that I didn't know if that was his ending it once and for all or if it had really ended months or years prior or if he was going to call me again two days or six months down the line just to check-in.

    <div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">Contrary to what GPT-3 (and probably Omar) says, I wasn't devastated the fairytale didn't come true.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">The reality is more complicated: we were never really dating so we never really broke up, but we were never really friends so I didn't get to be upset when he relied on me for emotional validation or trivialized my feelings or ghosted.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x"><span class=active>The reality is less romantic: a man tells a woman he doesn’t want to be with her after spending years looking for his “soul mate,” and then</span> meets someone <span class=active>soon afterwards. She doesn’t tell her friends for a few months, gets her heart broken quietly into pieces while believing she is slowly piecing it back together, then tells everyone at once that it doesn't matter anymore.</span></p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x"><span class=active>On occasion</span> the model’s predicted outcome <span class=active>veered close enough to my truth that there was solace in</span> reading it from a distance. But, ultimately, they still weren’t true.</p>

<p class="block locked svelte-ykce8x">I decided if Omar refused to write an ending and I didn't agree with how GPT-3 filled it in, then I would write my own. <span class=active>Even if I needed some help along the way.</span></p>

<section id="method" class="svelte-3j09iz"><h3 class="svelte-3j09iz">Methodology</h3>
    <p class="svelte-3j09iz">We used either the base 175B parameter model or a version fine-tuned on “following instructions” for all GPT-3 generations. Prompts were a mix of different versions of the story, the "relationship-related" text that appears above the story, direct continuations of paragraphs as they appear in the story, or some outside text that has since been edited.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">In other cases, mostly where you see rotating "mad-libs" options of text, we would prompt the model with a “headline” like "Lists of classic Cambridge activities," followed by samples that fit the flow of text and were examples of what we’d want. This is called few-shot learning, we give the model a few samples of what we're looking for and let GPT-3 do the rest.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">We tried our best not to shoehorn responses. For example, I wanted to place a reference to Estelle's “American Boy” in one spot but couldn't get the model to cooperate. Other times cooperation felt like cheating, e.g. putting <i>You've Got Mail</i> in the prompt gets <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> in return.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">For the overfitting section we deliberately lowered the temperature to induce looping behavior from the model. Other generations were done with a temperature between .7 and .9.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">Being trained on the internet also means that the model replicates and magnifies the toxicity of those forums. As one example, GPT-3, prompted only with Omar's name will spew racist and anti-Muslim rhetoric. This and other encoded biases in language models perpetuate real harm when language models are released in the real world. To learn more about these and other dangers of big language models, I recommend <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf target=_blank>Bender, Gebru et. al.</a> and <a href=http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf target=_blank>the original GPT-3 paper</a>. Access to the model is governed by strict usage guidelines and a content filter is available, but there is, as always, work to do and plenty of debate to be had.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">This cherrypicking often changes the shape and sound of a story that is on the surface “mine.”</p></section>

<section id="note" class="svelte-3j09iz"><h3 class="svelte-3j09iz">Author&#39;s Note</h3>
    <p class="svelte-3j09iz">It’s easy to say I should cite everywhere the model is used but this doesn’t fully cover the ways the model influenced the shape and sound of how I wrote this piece.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">Whether or not you are cribbing precise generations, it's easy for a story to take on the shape of the model. When generations don’t look how I’d expect I start to edit out details and nuance in the prompt until the model realizes, “Oh, he had to run to the train station because his bike was stolen.” My writing starts to sound like GPT-3, I repeat similar phrases, lose focus in the middle of a sentence, and fall back on cliched tropes that feel close enough to the truth. Over time and drafts, the inputs and outputs converge.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">When I started writing this, I just thought it would be funny to have a language model fill in the blanks on my scathing email drafts. Then I thought getting dating advice from AI would be a good pitch. But, Writing with GPT-3, it is hard not to drown in the power of suggestion, “Oh that is a really good framing,” and lose sight of the truth, “No, I really wanted to just be friends!” Even if you feel that truth deeply. It's similar to writing with an editor, albeit one far less compassionate and patient than Jan is.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">I say all this precisely to get off the hook for what is written here. The process is fun ("Rewrite this story as Tosca and Taylor Swift and Tolstoy"), until it's time to hit publish and Omar tells me he can't wait to learn the truth from what I write and GPT-3 tells me my writing sounds like a <span>young woman</span> or a <span>teen magazine</span> (which are labels I should not scoff at, but do, but hopefully only because of what I know of the model's internalized misogyny).</p>
