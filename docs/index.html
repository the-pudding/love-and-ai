The rest was <span class=switch>getting lost in the library stacks, walking hand in hand across the Bridge of Sighs.</span><span>sitting in the grass on the lawn of King's College, laughing our arses off of the Footlights Pantomime.</span><span>fumbling our way through the college bar crawl, cycling to Grantchester for tea and scones.</span> We were filling in the outline of a love story I'd written in my head reading novels and Instagram posts by American women studying abroad.  It was the perfect beginning but it happened at the end of the year.

    <div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">I am not a writer, I am a machine learning engineer. In my work the question of whether something is cliche or not, over or not is steeped in data and trendlines: How does it compare to the mode of the distribution? Is the shock transitory or permanent? Answering these questions requires poring over every piece of a dataset, extracting features that might mean something, identifying every possible inflection point. When I try to apply this energy to my love life (or lack thereof), friends tell me I’m “dwelling too much on the past” or “living in a fantasy world” or “not really their friend.”
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">So, when two years had passed and my feelings for Omar still weren’t resolved, I didn’t tell my friends. I told a supercomputer.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">GPT-3 — the third “generative pre-trained transformer” released by the start-up (and my employer) OpenAI — is an example of a language model, or a tool that predicts what sequence of words should follow a user-provided prompt. Given a prompt like, “Hello my name” it will, more often than not, suggest that the next word is <span>is</span>.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">It happens to be the biggest publicly released model of its kind: 175 billion parameters. The next largest is 17 billion. You can think of a parameter roughly as a synapse; the human brain has around 100 trillion of those, but it has to focus on lots of things besides language, like swiping on dating apps and moving to San Francisco. To learn all of those parameters, GPT-3 is trained on hundreds of billions of sentences and stories from the internet and books. Written something on Reddit? There’s a good chance GPT-3 has read it.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">This scale results in some remarkable generalizations. Because the model has read from so many different sources with so many different authors, and also because it is a computer, the model lacks self-awareness. So, given a prompt like, “Hi, I’m Pamela and Omar doesn’t love me.” GPT-3 will respond as me, <span class=active>Pamela, and write the story of a relationship with all the poeticism and pathos and, yes, melodrama, that any young woman who has been dumped could ever want.<span>
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">Being trained on the internet also means that the model replicates, and potentially magnifies, the toxicity of those forums. The generations shown in this essay are cherry-picked to demonstrate particular aspects of the model and what it taught me about my relationship and GPT-3. They're also chosen to minimize the reader's exposure to harmful and toxic content. As one example, GPT-3 tends to take Omar's name and, likely because of its Arab origin, spew racist and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Other responses are sexist and misogynistic. These and other encoded biases perpetuate real harm when language models are released in the real world. To learn more about this I recommend <a href=http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf target=_blank>Bender, Gebru et al</a>.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">Others test using AI to probe the human psyche. They say this reveals something about how humans learn or the nature of intelligence.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">One argument against the model’s intelligence is that it has a tendency to “overfit,” or get lost in endless loops of repetitive language. This happens when the model essentially memorizes its training data and assumes that everything else should look like it.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">You meet someone, you fall in love, you break up, and, heartbroken, you assume you'll never find anyone who compares. You look for a perfect substitute.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">While models have gotten better at avoiding these traps as they’ve gotten larger, there are still sequences of words and language that trigger this spiraling behavior.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">Omar and I were stuck in a loop. I would text, he wouldn't respond for a few weeks, and then would call one day to check-in.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">I tell GPT-3 this and get back, <span class=switch>He says he's sorry. He says he's not sorry. He says he's sorry. He says he's not sorry. He says he's…</span><span>He called. I didn't answer. I called. He didn't answer. I texted. He didn't respond. I called. He didn't answer. I texted. He didn't respond. I called. He didn't answer.</span><span>I cry when I think about how much I wanted to be with him. I was so lonely. I was so sad. I was so desperate. I was so stupid. I was so stupid. I was so stupid. I was so stupid. I was so stupid. I was so stupid. I was so stupid.</span> GPT-3's loops feel reminiscent of picking petals on the schoolyard, "He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not." Loops can be exhausting.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">Occasionally one of us would say something that crossed whatever friendship boundary lay between us, a shift in tone somehow more relevant than the 5000 miles. I would text, he wouldn't respond for a few weeks, and then would call one day to tell me about someone new he'd met.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">I learn that in the original French version of the schoolyard petal rhyme you don't just loop through "He loves me. He loves me not." but question how far the other person's affection goes: un peu, beaucoup, passionnément, à la folie, pas du tout.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">He loves me a little. He loves me a lot. He loves me passionately. He loves me to madness. He loves me not at all.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">I would text, he wouldn't respond for a few weeks, and then would call one day to tell me about his recent break-up.

    <div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">When you prompt GPT-3, you request a certain number of words back. A language model is only able to handle a limited number of words in prompt plus generation. This means that it may end your story mid-sentence or thought. Or, it may reach an ending and then keep generating because it’s been instructed to talk for a certain amount of time about the characters it’s been prompted with. If there are two characters in its universe you are forced to engage with them, even after they and you should have moved on.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">Despite our awkwardness, it was casual enough that I was not surprised when, a year after I'd left England, he asked if I needed a place to stay on a layover in London. There was anticipation but not expectation when we discussed how his roommates would feel about someone sleeping on the couch.

    <div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">Because the model's training data ends in 2019, interacting with it can feel like jumping into a nostalgia machine. In a way GPT-3 contextualizes and quantifies just how strange this year is compared to last.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j">In the model's endings, sometimes we end up quarantined for COVID-19 together in French Polynesia. Other times he gets the virus and we never see each other again. Sometimes GPT-3 displays the dangers of being trained on the internet, devolving into sexist rants. In many, when I tell GPT-3 that I am mid-pandemic and am using AI to explain my love story I end up falling in love with the AI and running off with it. I suppose there’s a lot of dystopian fan-fiction available as training data.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-dapx7j"><span class=active>On occasion</span> the model’s predicted outcome <span class=active>veered close enough to my truth that there was solace in</span> reading it from a distance.

<section id="method" class="svelte-3j09iz"><h3 class="svelte-3j09iz">Methodology</h3>
    <p class="svelte-3j09iz">We used the 175B parameter model for all GPT-3 generations. Prompts were a mix of the "relationship-related" text that appears above the story, direct continuations of paragraphs as they appear in the story, or some outside text that has since been edited.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">In other cases, mostly where you see rotating "mad-libs" options of text, we prompted the model to generate "Lists of classic Cambridge activities" for example, followed by samples that fit the flow of text. This is called few-shot learning, we give the model a few examples of what we're looking for and let GPT-3 do the rest.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">We tried our best not to shoehorn responses. For example, I desperately wanted the model to place a reference to Estelle's American Boy and The Fray's Vienna in one spot but couldn't get GPT-3 to cooperate. Other times I could get GPT-3 to cooperate but it felt like cheating, e.g. if I do one-shot with You've Got Mail I can get it to give me Sleepless in Seattle in return.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">For the overfitting section we deliberately lowered the temperature to induce looping behavior from the model. Other generations were done with a temperature between .7 and .9.</p></section>

<section id="note" class="svelte-3j09iz"><h3 class="svelte-3j09iz">Author&#39;s Note</h3>
    <p class="svelte-3j09iz">What is the right way to employ GPT-3 and give credit to the model? This is a question I struggled with throughout writing and editing this, and that I think will continue being debated for a long time to come. It’s easy to say I should cite everywhere it is used but this doesn’t fully cover the ways the model influences the shape and sound of how I wrote this piece.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">Whether or not you are cribbing precise generations, it's easy for a story to take on the shape of the model. Generations don’t look how I’d expect so I start to edit out details and nuance in the prompt that may be confusing until the model realizes, “Oh, he had to run to the train station because his bike was stolen.” The inputs and outputs converge with the fuzziness of the past and the contentiousness of the truth and before you know it you're writing circular sentences that repeat similar phrases and have fairly basic ideas.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">When I started writing this, I just thought it would be funny to have a language model fill in the blanks on my scathing email drafts. Then I thought getting dating advice from AI would be a good Modern Love pitch. But writing with GPT-3, it is hard not to drown in the power of suggestion, “Oh that is a really good framing,” and lose sight of the truth, “No, I really wanted to just be friends!” Even if you feel that truth deeply. It's similar to writing with an editor, albeit one far less compassionate and patient than Jan is.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">It feels fine, and fun (let's rewrite this as Tosca and Taylor Swift and Tolstoy), until it's time to hit publish and Omar tells me he can't wait to learn the truth from what I write and GPT-3 tells me my writing sounds like a <span>young woman</span> writing for a <span>teen magazine</span> (which is a label I should not scoff at, but do, because of what I know of the model's internalized misogyny).</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">This means the model is very good at filling in the details for the parts of the story where Omar and I are in love: romantic strolls and eating too many Colin the Caterpillars and stolen stares over video chats when we were supposed to be working. It just often misses the specificity of a relationship that fell apart slowly: the dress that blew away, the awkward kiss that makes me cringe to this day, the train from London to Cambridge we missed by a few minutes.</p><p class="svelte-3j09iz">Every love story is generic; every break-up is specific in its own way. That's how Tolstoy put it, right?</p>
