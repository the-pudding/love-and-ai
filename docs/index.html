  </section><section id="section-1"><div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">GPT-3 — the third “generative pre-trained transformer” released by the start-up (and my employer) OpenAI — is an example of a language model, or a tool that predicts what sequence of words should follow a user-provided prompt. Given a prompt like, “Hello my name” it will, more often than not, suggest that the next word is <span>is</span>.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">It happens to be the biggest publicly released model of its kind: 175 billion parameters. The next largest is 17 billion. You can think of a parameter roughly as a synapse; the human brain has around 100 trillion of those, but it has to focus on lots of things besides language, like swiping on dating apps and moving to San Francisco. To learn all of those parameters, GPT-3 is trained on hundreds of billions of sentences and stories from the internet and books. Written something on Reddit? There’s a good chance GPT-3 has read it.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">This scale results in some remarkable generalizations: while the model has not eaten dumplings on the King’s College lawn, it has “read” Sylvia Plath and Caroline Calloway and every Modern Love essay ever written and it has “learned” heartbreak from Tosca and Taylor Swift and back issues of Sassy. Because the model has read from so many different sources with so many different authors, and also because it is a computer, the model lacks self-awareness. Given a prompt like “Hi, I’m Pamela and O doesn’t love me” it will respond as me, <span class=active>Pamela, and write the story of a relationship with all the poeticism and pathos and, yes, melodrama, that any young woman who has been dumped could ever want</span>.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">I entered different permutations of my story, asking the model questions of what had gone wrong, hoping I could identify variables to land at the ending I wanted, or, I thought, find the variable that was to blame for the ending I had.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">“What if his bike hadn’t been stolen after our second date?”
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2"><span class=switch>If O’s bike hadn't been stolen, it would have ended a lot sooner. He wouldn’t have needed to run to the train station.</span><span>I would have stood him up on our third date. Because I was still really raw from the guy I’d dated for the previous two years. I knew all the signs of a commitment phobe. But I was still really into O and I still wanted to get to know him better.</span><span>We would be engaged right now.</span><span>We would be engaged right now.</span>
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">“What if he hadn’t just gotten out of a seven year relationship?”
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2"><span class=switch>If he hadn’t just gotten out of a seven year relationship, they almost certainly would have married and had kids.</span><span>He still would have been in a seven-year relationship. We would have broken up, but maybe we would have been friends.</span><span>I might have fallen in love for good.</span>
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">“What if I’d flown back to England on a unicorn made of marshmallows?”
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2"><span class=switch>I would have been pretty confused.</span><span>I’d have let the marshmallow unicorn melt.</span><span>I would have been six inches tall and I would have been eaten by a squirrel.</span><span>I would have had some really good Instagram content.</span>
</p>
</div>
    
  </section><section id="section-2"><div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">I first got access to the model in August. It was the fifth month of quarantine and I had recently moved home to face my teenage journals. I didn’t know if I missed talking to strangers or if I missed talking to O. But I wanted to know if, with enough prodding, I could turn GPT-3 into either, or at least convince myself that I had.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">While I knew then that the model is far from a qualified relationship coach or therapist (access for particular uses is governed by strict guidelines). I wanted to probe its capabilities on a task I knew intimately and I wanted to understand how to explain the model's capabilities and weaknesses in language that made sense to those close to me.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">At the same time, the process was a clear example of how my safety and security using this technology is directly linked to my identity as a White woman who was in a straight relationship.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">The generations shown in this essay are cherry-picked to demonstrate particular aspects of the model and what it taught me about my relationship and GPT-3. They're also chosen to minimize the reader's exposure to harmful and toxic content. As one example, GPT-3 tends to take O's name and, because of its Arab origin, spew racist and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Other responses are sexist and misogynistic. GPT-3 is trained on the internet, and it replicates, and potentially magnifies, the toxicity of those forums. This encoded bias can perpetuate real harm when language models are released in the real world.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">To learn more about this harm, as well as OpenAI’s response to it, I recommend the <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165 target=_blank>original GPT-3 paper</a> and <a href=http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf target=_blank>Bender, Gebru et al</a>.

  </section><section id="section-3"><div class="prose svelte-1exhpzg"><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">Others test using AI to solve medical mysteries or probe the human psyche. They say this reveals something about how humans learn or the nature of intelligence.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">One argument against the model’s intelligence is that it has a tendency to “overfit.” This happens when the model essentially memorizes the training data and assumes that everything else should look like it.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">You meet someone, you fall in love, you break up, and, heartbroken, you assume you'll never find anyone who compares. You look for a perfect substitute.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">In the context of a language model, "overfitting" tends to show up as endless loops of identical language. While models have gotten better at avoiding these traps as they’ve gotten larger, there are still sequences of words and language that trigger this spiraling behavior.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">O and I were stuck in a loop. I would text, he wouldn't respond for a few weeks, and then would call one day to check-in.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">Over the first year after I left Cambridge, we oscillated between chatting multiple times a day and not speaking for weeks. When we did talk, we mostly discussed whomever we were seeing at the time. I was rarely seeing anyone so he did most of the talking.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">Occasionally one of us would say something that crossed whatever friendship boundary lay between us, a shift in tone somehow more relevant than the 5000 miles. I would text, he wouldn't respond for a few weeks, and then would call one day to check-in.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">Despite this, it was casual enough that I was not surprised when he asked if I needed a place to stay on a layover in London. There was anticipation but not expectation when we discussed how his roommates would feel about someone sleeping on the couch.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">Around a week before I was due to arrive he stopped replying to me. Angry and embarrassed, I finally convinced him to meet me at the hotel my sister booked when she saw the writing on the wall. We walked and talked for eight hours and then we made out and then he said, “I finally feel comfortable being your friend.”
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">My friends say to Venmo-request him for the price of the hotel room. They say to delete his number and texts and Facebook messages and not to forget to disconnect on LinkedIn lest I "accidentally" congratulate him on a promotion years down the line. They say there’s no intelligence behind my desire to stay friends with him.

</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">I wanted the model to give me a better ending or maybe just to give me authority over the ending.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">Because the model's data ends in 2019, interacting with it can feel like jumping into a nostalgia machine, just like past relationships look better in the rearview. There's a lot of larger reminiscing that happens around COVID and GPT-3 contextualizes/quantifies just how strange this year is compared to last.
</p><p class="block locked svelte-7rdrt2">In GPT-3's endings, sometimes we end up quarantined for COVID-19 together in French Polynesia. Other times he gets the virus and we never see each other again. Sometimes GPT-3 displays the dangers of being trained on the internet, devolving into sexist rants. In many, when I tell GPT-3 that I am mid-pandemic and am using AI to explain my love story I end up falling in love with the AI and running off with it. I suppose there’s a lot of dystopian fan-fiction available as training data.
